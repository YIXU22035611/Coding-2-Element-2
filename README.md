## Assignment Description:
### I have always had a deep interest in the film Dune, its worldview, characters, and storyline captivated me. After watching Dune 2, I designed an interactive poster for my final coding2 assignment, combining my knowledge from class and my own ideas, and adding many relevant elements, such as the Dune font, blue eyes, lines, sandworms, etc. The poster will allow people to experience the unique charm of the world of Dune. It allows the person interacting to experience the unique world of Dune.
### Firstly, I used face tracking techniques, utilising ml5.js's faceApi to implement dynamic tracking of the eyes. When the user moves in front of the camera, they will see blue eyes on the screen following their line of sight, resembling the blue eye effect unique to Fremen in Dune. I ran into some difficulties here; the more code I added to subsequent interactions, the less sensitive the recognised blue eyes became, and this still needs to continue to be tweaked. 
### Next, I used the Boid algorithm to handle the surround effect of the text. I applied this algorithm to the text so that the text of the lines in the dunes travelled through the frame like sandworms, clustering or dispersing depending on the position of the user's face.
### In addition, I chose the Dune themed font and colour scheme to display the text "DUNE" as a unique art form on the screen. When the user's eyes move, the letters will dynamically disperse or gather depending on the average position of the eyes, which makes my interactive poster more vivid and interesting.
### Finally, to add to the overall sense of atmosphere, I added background music. A sound track matching the theme of Dune was chosen and played on a loop to create an immersive experience.
### Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my programming skills and love for the world of Dune, as well as create a unique interactive experience that allowed participants to get a feel for the world of Dune. It was a tribute to the great work of Dune and an exploration of my programming and creativity.
